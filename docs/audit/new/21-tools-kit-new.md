# NEW: cmd/kit-new (scaffold generator)

**Phase**: 6 (Agent-readiness; companion to `cmd/kit-doctor`)
**Module path**: `github.com/bds421/rho-kit/cmd/kit-new`

## Why

`kit-doctor` enforces correctness in existing services. `kit-new` *generates* a correct service from scratch. Together they bracket the lifecycle:

- `kit-new my-service` → service skeleton wired to the golden path with all secure defaults.
- `kit-doctor ./...` → ongoing check that the service hasn't drifted.

Agents benefit most: instead of reasoning about which `With*` calls to wire, they invoke `kit-new` and edit business logic.

## What it generates

## Flags

```
kit-new <service-name>
  --dir=<output-path>              (default: ./<service-name>)
  --modules=db,redis,amqp,jwt      (which infra to wire — default: db,jwt,metrics)
  --tenant                         (include multi-tenant primitives from new/20)
  --token=jwt|paseto               (which token format — default: jwt for compat)
  --license=...
  --module-path=github.com/.../my-service
```

## Templates

Templates live in `cmd/kit-new/templates/` as Go `text/template` files. Each `--modules` flag toggles inclusion of conditional blocks. Snapshot tests verify generated output compiles and passes `kit-doctor`.

## Self-test

`kit-new --self-test` generates a service into a temp dir, runs `go build`, `go test`, and `kit-doctor` against it. CI runs this on every kit release so generated services never bit-rot.

## Definition of done

- [x] CLI binary with `-module-path` and `-dir` flags. ✅ this PR
- [x] Templates for the minimal file tree (cmd/<name>/main.go, internal/app/wire.go, go.mod, README.md, Makefile, AGENTS.md, .github/workflows/ci.yml). The `--modules`, `--tenant`, and `--token` flags from the original scope are deferred — they belong with the corresponding new-package Builder integrations (which themselves are still pending under their own audit items).
- [x] Generated service compiles and `go vet`s clean (covered by `TestScaffold_GeneratedTreeBuildsAndPasses`). The CI workflow template runs `kit-doctor` so consumer services stay aligned post-generation.
- [x] Snapshot tests via `TestScaffold_GeneratesExpectedTree` and the build self-test.
- [x] Self-test integrated into the standard `go test` run (no separate flag needed; `testing.Short()` skips it).
- [x] Adding a template documented in main.go package comment.
- [ ] Deploy/k8s + deploy/grafana + deploy/prometheus templates (deferred to the dashboards audit item, [new/22]).
